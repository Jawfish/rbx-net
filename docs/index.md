RbxNet is a _networking library_ for Roblox, built in TypeScript. It simplifies the creation and management of networking in Roblox.

!!! info "Info"
    While RbxNet is primarily a Roblox TypeScript library, it also is available for Lua. 

## Features
- Creation & Usage of remotes through "IDs". The actual remotes are managed by Net.
- More explicit, contextual APIs. `Server` objects are explicitly for the server, `Client` objects explicitly for the client.
- Asynchronous remote functions (`Net*AsyncFunction`) - Which unlike regular remote functions allow timeouts and safely calling clients without issues.
- Asynchronous methods - part of being a roblox-ts built library is the support for `Promise`.
- Caching - Results from RemoteFunctions can be cached on the client for a set amount of time.
- Throttling - RemoteFunctions and RemoteEvents can be set to throttle requests.
- [Type Safety](type-safety/) - Using a library such as `t`, you can explicitly set what your RemoteFunctions/RemoteEvents accept as valid arguments. Any invalid arguments will be discarded.
- GlobalServerEvents - Special RemoteEvent-like objects that use MessagingService to communicate cross-server. Limitations of MessagingService are automatically handled through it.
- Serialization Helpers - Net.Serialize, Net.Deserialize, Net.IsSerializable
